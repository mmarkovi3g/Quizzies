#Quizzies app

Basic idea:
(first steps)

- Quizz questions are generated by CHATGPT
- User inputs category and number of question
- App generates random quizz based on input values
- User plays the quizz and gets points
- Points are being added to general user score after each quizz
- Add icon according to quizz category
- Create visual identity for Quizzies

Extra features:
(need to learn more to implement them correctly)

- User can create questions in app and send them to the server where it will be reviewed and added to the main list of questions
- User can login and the score can be saved with login data (need server and backend knowledge for this)
- Optional - achievements - user gets achievements based on activity
- Mobile version with React native
