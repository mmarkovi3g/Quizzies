#Quizzies app

Idea is to build my own aplication as I am big fun of pub-quizzes. App should render random quiz acording to user input (1 or more categories, and number of questions). First workable version would have one type of questions.

- optional \*
  I would like to implement option for users to add questions to the quizzies.

Technologies used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React
