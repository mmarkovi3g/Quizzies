#Quizzies app

During the process of learning front-end technology (React), I decided to create my own quiz application. The main idea was to develop a small application while learning React in order to practice the concepts I'm studying. However, the idea started to evolve, and with each new lesson, new ideas come along. As a result, this initially simple project gradually transforms into a more serious endeavor.

Basic idea:
(first steps and planning path)

- ✔️ Import at least 30 quizzie questions a day (cca. 10 000 yearly)
- ✔️ User inputs category and number of question - App generates random quizzie based on input values
- ✔️ User plays the quizz and gets points - Points are being added to general user score after each quizzie
- ✔️ Add icon according to quizz category - done
- ✔️ Store questions and correct answers into array / object and render them at the end of the quizzie
- ✔️ Implement algorithm for filtering duplicate questions (i do this manually with some script)
- Optional - change collor scheme for diferent categories (sounds fun)
- Create visual identity for Quizzies website (logo, colors)
- ✔️ Add more categories (added: Movies, ...)
- Add better algorithm for Quizzie creation (based on number of categories)
- ✔️ Show wrong and correct answers at the end of the Quizzie
- ⚠️ Refactor the code - it seems to me that it is too complicated right now
- ⚠️ See if there is a way to lower number of props in each component
- ✔️ Add button to start new Quizzie
- Add timer on Quizzie according to number of questions (at the end of timer end quizzie)

Extra features:
(need to learn more to implement them correctly)

- Publish Quizzies
- User can create questions in app and send them to the server where it will be reviewed and added to the main list of question
- ⚠️ Improve on algorythm for generating random questions - reduce repeated question on user expirience
- User can login and the score can be saved with login data (need server and backend knowledge for this)
- Achievements - user gets achievements based on activity
- Create multiple types of questions (eg. with images, right or wrong)
- Add wikipedia reference on certain topics after the quizz have been completed (maybe based on incorect questions)
- Mobile version with React native - Android
