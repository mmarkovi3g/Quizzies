#Quizzies app

Basic idea:
(first steps and planning path)

- ✔️ Quizzie questions are generated by CHATGPT - (can i automate this? )
- ✔️User inputs category and number of question - App generates random quizzie based on input values
- ✔️ User plays the quizz and gets points - Points are being added to general user score after each quizzie
- ✔️ Add icon according to quizz category - done
- Optional - change collor scheme for diferent categories
- Create visual identity for Quizzies website (logo, colors)
- Add more categories
- Add better algorithm for quizzie creation (based on number of categories)
- Show corrected answers at the end of the Quizzie - or during the quizz (with colors)
- Refactor the code - it seems to me that it is too complicated right now
- See if there is a way to lower number of props in each component
- ⚠️Add button to start new quizzie

Extra features:
(need to learn more to implement them correctly)

- Publish Quizzies
- User can create questions in app and send them to the server where it will be reviewed and added to the main list of questions
- User can login and the score can be saved with login data (need server and backend knowledge for this)
- Optional - achievements - user gets achievements based on activity
- Mobile version with React native - Android
