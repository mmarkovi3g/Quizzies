# Quizzies app

## Important: <br>

I am working on this project independently from internet - which means without using Google, Chat GPT, YouTube videos, and the like. While learning React.js through Jonas Schmedtmann's course, I have learned to use it on my own and implement it in the project. Most of the other projects I have on my GitHub account are primarily from courses where I followed a "watch and write" approach. This is my independent project for which I do not seek help on the internet but strive to be creative and design different parts of the application by breaking down problems into smaller components and challenges. </b>

Questions in JSON file are being generated by ChatGPT moslty and I used some open-sourced questions which I recreated in right format by using ChatGPT.

## Milestones and goals in developement procces: <br>

### Legend: <br>

✔️ - milestone achieved <br>
🕗 - in procces <br>
⚠️ - important next milestone <br>
❓ - need to learn more to achieve goal <br>

✔️ Import at least 30 quizzie questions a day (cca. 10 000 yearly) <br>
🕗 Review the questions manually <br>
✔️ Create separate app for removing duplicate questions <br>
✔️ User inputs category and number of question - App generates random quizzie based on input values <br>
✔️ User plays the quizz and gets points for correct answers <br>
✔️ Add icon according to quizz category - done <br>
✔️ Store questions and correct answers into array / object and render them at the end of the quizzie <br>
✔️ Implement algorithm for filtering duplicate questions (i do this manually with some script) <br>
⚠️ Optional - change color scheme for diferent categories (sounds fun) <br>
⚠️ Create visual identity for Quizzies website (logo, colors) <br>
🕗 Add more categories (added: Movies, ...) <br>
⚠️ Add better algorithm for Quizzie creation (based on number of categories) <br>
✔️ Show wrong and correct answers at the end of the Quizzie <br>
🕗 Refactor the code - it seems to me that it is too complicated right now (break into smaller components, rewrite variables) <br>
🕗 See if there is a way to lower number of props in each component <br>
✔️ Add button to start new Quizzie <br>
⚠️ Add timer on Quizzie according to number of questions (at the end of timer end quizzie) <br>

### Extra features: <br>

(need to learn backend, publish Quizzies and optionaly create native app) <br>

❓ Publish Quizzies after creating backend <br>
❓ Points are being added to general user score after each quizzie (need database for this) <br>
❓ User can create questions in app and send them to the server where it will be reviewed and added to the main list of question <br>
❓ User can review existing questions <br>
⚠️ Improve on algorythm for generating random questions - reduce repeated question on user expirience <br>
❓Enhace user expirience by creating quizz scores / profile sites / badges according to categories <br>
❓User can login and the score can be saved with login data (need server and backend knowledge for this) <br>
❓Achievements - user gets achievements based on activity <br>
❓Create multiple types of questions (eg. with images, right or wrong) <br>
❓Add wikipedia reference on certain topics after the quizz have been completed (maybe based on incorect questions) <br>
❓Mobile version with React native - Android <br>
